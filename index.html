            Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland
            invented HTML in 1991. This first version consisted of 18 HTML tages. Now,
            there are currently about 140 HTML tags, although not all of them are
            supported by modern browsers. Learn more about Tim Berners-Lee here

        <ul>
            <li><strong>1991</strong> - Tim Berners-Lee invents HTML 1.0</li>
            <li>
                <strong>1993</strong> - HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are
                creating websites at this time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1995</strong> - HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the
                features of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard
                markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1997</strong> - HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett
                introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML
                and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing
                websites. Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser
                in applying further improvements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1999</strong> - The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very
                successful.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>2014</strong> - HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is
                said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in
                2012.
            </li>
